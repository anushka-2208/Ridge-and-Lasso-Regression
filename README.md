In this project, we explored the implementation of Ridge and Lasso regression models using the popular Boston Housing dataset. The Boston dataset contains various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and proximity to employment centers, which are used to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes.

Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the cost function, known as L2 regularization. This penalty term helps prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients towards zero, thereby reducing the model's complexity. By tuning the regularization parameter, we aimed to find the optimal balance between model simplicity and predictive performance.

Lasso regression, on the other hand, utilizes L1 regularization, which also introduces a penalty term to the cost function. Lasso regression not only shrinks the coefficients but can also perform feature selection by driving some coefficients exactly to zero. This characteristic makes Lasso regression particularly useful in situations where there are many irrelevant or redundant features.

We performed data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Next, we trained Ridge and Lasso regression models on the training data and evaluated their performance on the testing data using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.

By comparing the results of Ridge and Lasso regression, we observed how the regularization techniques affected the model's coefficients and predictive power. We also examined the impact of different regularization strengths on the models' performance.

Overall, this project provided a practical demonstration of Ridge and Lasso regression using the Boston Housing dataset. The code and findings can be found in the GitHub repository, serving as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing these regression techniques in similar predictive modeling tasks.
