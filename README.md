# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression
This project explores Ridge and Lasso regression models using the Boston Housing dataset. Ridge regression adds a penalty term to prevent overfitting, while Lasso regression performs feature selection by shrinking coefficients to zero. The models were trained, evaluated, and compared based on their predictive performance.
